# Evolution of Containers and Kubernetes

There are two major software development evolutions that enabled the popularity of containers and Kubernetes. 

## 1. Microservices Architecture

One evolution is the adoption of a **microservices architectural style**. Microservices allow an application to be built from a collection of small services that each serve a specific function.

## 2. DevOps

The other evolution that enabled containers and Kubernetes is **DevOps**. DevOps is a set of cultural practices that allows people, processes, and tools to build and release software faster, more frequently, and more reliably.

Although you can use both containers and Kubernetes without using either microservices or DevOps, the technologies are most widely adopted for deploying microservices using DevOps methodologies.
