# Evolution of Containers and Kubernetes

There are two major software development evolutions that enabled the popularity of containers and Kubernetes. 

## 1. Microservices Architecture

One evolution is the adoption of a **microservices architectural style**. Microservices allow an application to be built from a collection of small services that each serve a specific function.

## 2. DevOps

The other evolution that enabled containers and Kubernetes is **DevOps**. DevOps is a set of cultural practices that allows people, processes, and tools to build and release software faster, more frequently, and more reliably.

Although you can use both containers and Kubernetes without using either microservices or DevOps, the technologies are most widely adopted for deploying microservices using DevOps methodologies.


## History of Docker and Kubernetes

Kubernetes has become the leading standard in container orchestration. Since its inception in 2014, created by Google – inspired by its own workload orchestration system, Borg – Kubernetes was donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Kubernetes has gained tremendous popularity, being adopted by start-ups as well as major enterprises, with all major public cloud vendors offering a managed Kubernetes service.

## Kubernetes builds upon the success of the Docker container revolution

Docker is both a company and the name of a technology. Docker as a technology is the most common way of creating and running software containers, called Docker containers. A container is a way of packaging software that makes it easy to run that software on any platform, ranging from your laptop to a server in a datacenter to a cluster running in the public cloud.

## Kubernetes Orchestration

Kubernetes takes containers to the next level. Kubernetes is a container orchestrator. A container orchestrator is a software platform that makes it easy to run many thousands of containers on top of thousands of machines. It automates a lot of the manual tasks required to deploy, run, and scale applications. The orchestrator takes care of scheduling the right container to run on the right machine. It also takes care of health monitoring and failover, as well as scaling your deployed application.

## Docker and Kubernetes are open-source projects

The container technology Docker uses and Kubernetes are both open-source software projects. Open-source software allows developers from many companies to collaborate on a single piece of software. Kubernetes itself has contributors from companies such as Microsoft, Google, Red Hat, VMware, and many others.

## Managed Kubernetes Services

The three major public cloud platforms—Azure, **Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**—all offer a managed Kubernetes service. They attract a lot of interest in the market since the virtually unlimited compute power and the ease of use of these managed services make it easy to build and deploy large-scale applications. 

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is Azure's managed service for Kubernetes. It reduces the complexity of building and managing Kubernetes clusters.
